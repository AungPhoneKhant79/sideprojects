- ðŸ“ˆ ETH Price Prediction (LSTM)
- **Project**:
- Predict Ethereumâ€™s closing price using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a type of RNN for sequential/time-series data
- 
- **Dataset**:
- ETH/USDT historical data (~1500 days), features = Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, train/test split = 70/30
- 
- **Method**:
- Scale data to [-1, 1]
- Sliding window: past 60 days â†’ predict next day
- Model: LSTM + Dense output layer
- Loss: MSE, Optimizer: Adam
- 
- **Results**:
- Best setup: 60-day window + 128 units
- Test MSE: ~0.00137
- Test MAE: ~0.0283
- 
- **Learnings**:
- Shorter windows (60 days) worked better than longer (120 days = noisy)
- More units (128) improved accuracy, too many (160+) began overfitting
- LSTMs capture short + long-term price patterns effectively
- 
- **Next Steps**:
- Add Dropout to reduce overfitting
- Compare with GRU and simple RNN
- Plot predictions vs actual prices for visualization
